# Frontend Developer Code Challenge

## Overview

In this task, you will make a pixel-perfect implementaton of the three images featured.  You may use whatever frontend CSS and HTML frameworks you like - the point of the exercise is just to demonstrate basic knowledge of and facility with CSS and HTML.

The included images are:

1. `ResourceMainMenu.png` - a view of a hypothetical resource management admin UI.  Note the callout menu in the upper right-hand corner of the image: **this menu should only appear on hover or click (your choice) of the dots icon**.  (There is no requirement to create this effect in pure CSS - if you prefer to use javascript, that's fine.)
2. `ResourceEntityMenu.png` - a view of the same menu as in (1), but showing a different callout menu.  As before, make sure that this menu only appears on hover or click (your choice).  As before, it doesn't matter whether you choose a pure CSS or a Javascript-based implementation; both are equally valid for the purposes of the task.
3. `OnePageDashboard.png` - a mobile view of the dashboard from the previous two images.  Your solution should support both mobile and fullscreen breakpoints.  (Supporting the full array of traditional breakpoints is of course encouraged, but the only two required for the task are a full desktop display and a standard mobile display.  The desktop display should look like the first two images, and the mobile display like this one.)


## Requirements

### Recreate the Mockups in HTML/CSS

The task is to recreate the images in HTML/CSS in a way that is as close to a "pixel-perfect" implementation of the mockup images as is reasonable.  It is OK if the images and icons don't exactly match, but the colors, fonts and layout should match as closely as possible.

### Include the Callout Menus

As mentioned in the previous section, be sure to include the callout menus as well, but **only in response to a hover or click**.    The callout menus should, of course, not be visible when the user initially visits the page.

###  Bonus

If you have extra time and are enjoying yourself, feel free to show off a bit by implementing more functionality!  For example, if you wanted to make basic landing pages for some of the callout menu items, that would be a great way to show what you can do!

## Evaluation

Your work will be evaluated on your ability to faithfully implement what is suggested by these mockups.  As mentioned in the "bonus" subsection of the previous section, you are free to go beyond what's here by adding additional pages if you're feeling inspired, but everything on the main dashboard page should look as close to *exactly* like what's in these mockup images as possible.  This task is graded on (a) competence with CSS and (b) attention to detail more than anything else.

## Submission

You can use any method you like to submit your assignment, but our preferred method is by posting it on some kind of git repo that we have access to (public repos are fine).  So, if you have a GitHub (or Gitlab or Bitbucket, etc.) account, the best way to submit your work is to create a public repo in your account with your solution and send us the link.
